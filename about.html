Hi, I'm Adrian Chen. I'm a Computer Engineering senior at Purdue University. <br>
<br>
I like all things open-source, and tinkering with various little projects to expand my knowledge of computing. I'm an amateur cook, and the only food I can't stand are boiled eggs. <br> 
<br>
My music taste: <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/user/adrianchen8662/">https://listenbrainz.org/user/adrianchen8662/</a>
